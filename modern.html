                Modern calligraphy is a style of hand-lettering that combines traditional calligraphy techniques with
                contemporary design elements. It is characterized by its fluid, elegant lines and its use of bold colors
                and patterns. Modern calligraphy is often used in branding, advertising, and other creative
                applications.

                    Modern calligraphy is a style of calligraphy that does not follow the fundamental rules of
                    traditional calligraphy scripts such as Copperplate, Spencerian, Italic, Blackletter, etc. Modern
                    calligraphy relies on certain principles of traditional calligraphy, such as the use of pointed pen
                    nibs and the importance of pen pressure, but it allows for more creative freedom.
